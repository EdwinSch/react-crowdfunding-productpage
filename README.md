## Crowdfund Page (React)

A landingpage for a (mock) crowdfunding project. The user can interact with the different pledge options and submit a pledge amount/choice. Data is actual and being rendered from a JSON. The project is very heavy on state management and dynamic styling with modals and collapsable navigation.

Showcasing: data handling, state handling, global context, input validation, dynmamic styling, module based SASS, and small animations.
